        In the realm of computational geometry, the Convex Hull algorithm stands
        as a cornerstone, addressing the fundamental problem of efficiently
        determining the smallest convex polygon enclosing a given set of points
        in a two-dimensional or higher-dimensional space. This problem finds
        wide-ranging applications across diverse fields such as computer
        graphics, robotics, geographic information systems (GIS), and image
        processing. Letâ€™s dive into understanding two of the most important
        algorithms for solving convex hulls namely, Jarvis March and KirkPatrick
        Seidel Algorithm.

      <h2>Kirkpatrick Seidel Algorithm</h2>

      <p style="background-color: rgba(211, 211, 211, 0.458)">
        The Kirkpatrick Seidel algorithm is a more advanced algorithm for
        finding the convex hull in higher dimensions. It combines
        divide-and-conquer with incremental methods to achieve a faster runtime.
        The algorithm recursively divides the point set into subsets and
        constructs convex layers for each subset, which are then merged to
        obtain the convex hull.

        <br /><br />

        The time complexity of the Kirkpatrick Seidel algorithm is computed
        based on the number of points in the input set and the number of points
        in the resulting convex hull. Let's denote: n: The number of input
        points. h: The number of points in the convex hull. The algorithm's time
        complexity can be derived as follows: The divide-and-conquer step
        involves recursively partitioning the input points, which takes O(n log
        n) time. The merge step involves combining the convex layers of each
        subset, which takes O(n) time. Overall, the time complexity is O(n log
        h).

      <h2>Jarvis March Algorithm</h2>
      <p style="background-color: rgba(211, 211, 211, 0.458)">
        The Jarvis March algorithm, also known as the gift wrapping algorithm,
        is a simple and intuitive method for finding the convex hull of a set of
        points. It iteratively selects the point with the smallest polar angle
        with respect to the current point and adds it to the convex hull. This
        process continues until the starting point is reached again. The time
        complexity of the Jarvis March algorithm is computed based on the number
        of points in the input set and the number of points in the resulting
        convex hull.
        <br /><br />
        Let's denote: n: The number of input points. h: The number of points in
        the convex hull. The algorithm's time complexity can be derived as
        follows: For each point in the convex hull, the algorithm iterates over
        all the input points to find the next point in the hull. This results in
        a time complexity of O(nh). In the worst-case scenario, every point in
        the input set is part of the convex hull, i.e., h = n. Therefore, the
        time complexity becomes O(n2).
